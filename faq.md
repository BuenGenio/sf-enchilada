# Frequently Asked Questions

## Features

### Fingerprint Reader

Currently only available for Sailfish X (official device). I will update if and when that changes.

### VoLTE (Data Calling)

Currently not available in Sailfish OS (all devices). I will update if and when that changes.

### Android Apps

There is some work on porting Anbox to Sailfish OS, it isn't currently a major priority and not something I'll be investing time into. If you message me about Android support I will probably ignore you.

### Updates

I will release updates for:

* New versions of Sailfish OS
* Breaking bug fixes
* Kernel optimisations

Please don't spam my inbox with requests for updates, they will come as soon as is feasible.
